    "description": "This coffee was grown by Jairo Arcila at the farm Santa Mónica. This coffee was exposed to a dry anaerobic fermentation period of 72 hours with the pulp on. During this fermentation stage strawberry and wine yeast were added. The cherries were then pulped and placed to dry on raised beds with ripe strawberry placed amongst the coffee until the ideal moisture content was achieved.",

    "description": "It is the union of three small farms that produce specialty coffees, free of defects and of great taste complexity. Jump is the perfect result of the art of Italian mixing with an international approach and taste. Our blend stands out for its medium acidity with hints of lime and lemon, combined with pleasant notes of hazelnut and almond. Very pleasant chocolate finish.",
